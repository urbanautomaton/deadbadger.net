I apologise, and offer the following:</p>
<p>Born fully-bearded into the loveless marriage of Clements Freud and Atlee, the young Noel&#8217;s massively outsized forearms immediately marked him out for great things. Having enjoyed early success as an animatronic garden ornament, Noel&#8217;s destiny in show business was sealed when he fronted the Voiceless Velar Fricatives, an avant-garde folk-hop group whose backing singers consisted solely of minors with speech impediments. To avoid crowd sympathy leading to his backers gaining a higher profile than him, Edmonds insisted that they perform in blackface, earning him his famous nickname, “that bearded shit”.</p>
<p>The Velars having split due to creatine imbalances, Edmonds made perhaps one of the century&#8217;s greatest contributions to radio when he moved into broadcast television. Initially confined to the relative backwaters of Ukrainian public service cable, Edmonds&#8217; ingratiating manner won him double the audience of his nearest rivals within weeks of his show&#8217;s premiere.</p>
<p>Following a petition and street demonstration by both of his viewers, Edmonds was headhunted by the BBC, who had mistranslated a demand for his decapitation. From this point on his life story becomes a matter of public record, although aides on “Noel&#8217;s House Party” insist that far from being the creative force behind Mr Blobby, Edmonds was in fact blackmailed into including the character by a gay North London drug dealer going by the name of “Snoopy”, who threatened to expose Edmonds&#8217; secret ventriloquism fetish.</p>
<p>Presently best known for fronting hit empirical Darwinism project “Deal or Complete Moron”, Noel satisfies his latent public coprophilia by secretly shitting in the lowest value box at each show. One of his stated aims for the future is to collaborate with George Lucas on a remastering of every episode of Noel&#8217;s House Party, in which all gunge is to be replaced with digitally generated Ewok poop.</p>
<p>When asked for a comment, Edmonds replied, “fuck off; can&#8217;t you see I&#8217;m shitting in this box?”</p>
<hr />
<p>Be thankful I didn&#8217;t choose to respond to the person who googled “cow udder fetish”.</p>
<p>No, really.</p>

						<p>I always like a good bit of stupidity, as long as I&#8217;m participating in it, and not having it inflicted upon me. Unfortunately this episode is an example of the latter, but I can look back and laugh. </p>
<p>Aged about 6 or so I used to suffer from continuous and excruciating ear infections. For a while it was attributed to my mother&#8217;s penchant for listening to Chris de Burgh on long car journeys, but altruistic thieves eventually stole the offending tapes from our Cavalier, demonstrating diagnostic powers in marked contrast to their woeful musical tastes. Not the eyebrowed wonder&#8217;s fault, then. </p>
<p><img src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/electrocap.jpg" alt="Electro cap" title="Bzzzzt! WRRRONG!" width="184" height="247" class="size-full wp-image-316 alignright" /></p>
<p>As a last-ditch effort to avoid having holes poked in my ears (all the better to hear Lady in Red), allergy diagnosis was given a shot. The unfortunate thing about allergy diagnosis, however, is that it&#8217;s slow and boring and there aren&#8217;t any sensible shortcuts. About the only way to do it properly is a blind elimination diet, in which blind people are cooked and eaten to pacify the ear gods. </p>
<p>Ah ha, I slay me. No, it involves removing each suspected allergen from the diet for a period of time without the subject knowing what the change is, then reintroducing it and waiting for emesis. If you&#8217;ve ever tried to get an already-picky 6-year-old to eat anything foreign, you can surely imagine the challenge of not only repeatedly altering their diet, but getting them to eat it without telling them what it is, then expecting to reliably observe a difference in the speed with which it is returned to sender. Hardly surprising, then, that I got shopped around some more exotic “specialists”, who promised far more rapid results. </p>
<p>There are lots of hilariously stupid means of “testing” for allergies. First (and slightly dull in its conception) comes electrodermal skin testing, in which a vial of the suspected allergen is connected in series with the patient (in my case by having my toes poked by electrodes) and some ludicrous Heath Robinson contraption with lots of impressive-looking dials, meters (analogue, of course) and pointless external capacitors (it&#8217;s a lot like high-end hi-fi in this regard). Twiddling ensues, readings are taken, and a pronouncement is made. </p>
<p>“Hmm,” says the alleged doctor. “You appear to be allergic to the two most common childhood allergens.” </p>
<p>“Goodness,” one replies, “how clever of you,” handing over one&#8217;s cash in awe at the still-oscillating hoojamajigger attached to your toe. </p>
<p><img src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/appliedkinesiology.jpg" alt="Applied Kinesiology" title="&quot;Trust me; I&#039;m a dickhead&quot;" width="170" height="173" class="size-full wp-image-317 alignleft" /></p>
<p>Far more fun, and infinitely more woo, is Applied Kinesiology. The idea here is that the subject holds a vial of an allergen in one hand, and extends their other arm parallel to the ground. The “doctor” presses down on the extended hand. Should the subject be allergic to the vial&#8217;s contents, his energy will be disrupted and he will find himself unable to resist the downward pressure applied by the idiot poking his hand. </p>
<p>So far, so stupid, but it gets better. Aged six I was clearly in no position to resist the strength of a fully-grown moron, whether my cosmic flow was being altered by desiccated celery or not. Not letting this minor detail get between himself and a full consultancy fee, however, the moron in question suggested that I sit on my mother&#8217;s lap. I would hold the vial, my mother would hold out her arm, and the moron would press down on that. Genius! Only a hidebound cynic would question the transitive property of celery disturbance. Hug ye not a hayfever sufferer, for he will drain you of your very life force! Anyway. This is what we did. </p>
<p>“Hmm,” said the alleged doctor. “You appear to be allergic to the two most common childhood allergens.” </p>
<p>“Goodness,” we replied, “however did you work that out, having only probability and observable classic symptoms on your side?” </p>
<p>Only we didn&#8217;t, of course; we believed him. And that&#8217;s how a complete idiot doomed me to years of Ryvita sandwiches and rice cakes by being only half right. For years I wasn&#8217;t allowed wheat. Wheat. No bread, no biscuits, no pancakes; I had Ryvita sandwiches, for crying out loud. I don&#8217;t imagine you&#8217;ve had a Ryvita sandwich. They have the flavour of carpet underlay and the alluring texture of plastic forks. The most satisfaction that can be gained from them is finding the ones where the dimples don&#8217;t quite tesselate properly and mailing them to the manufacturer to demand a refund. I hid them behind the toilets until the stack got so large they fell out one day, concussing the janitor. That&#8217;s when the rice cakes started. Lighter, you see; less dangerous. </p>
<p>I appear to be rambling now, so I&#8217;m going to stop. That&#8217;s craft for you.</p>

<p>Hi. I wrote to you recently, you may recall, regarding the lamentable problems concerning the filling of the vending machine (enclosed). It&#8217;s all right &#8211; I&#8217;m starting to quite like Berry Blast, not to mention the mild excitement of not knowing whether today will be the day my Dr Pepper returns to me. What a day that will be!</p>
<p>However, my colleague has just informed me that the button marked “purple” Berry Blast is in fact vending a sort of yellowish beverage. This is most unsatisfactory for him, colourblind as he is. He can still taste the difference, you understand; he&#8217;s not a racist or anything.</p>
<p>Would it be possible to return to a semblance of labelling normality, or at least a consistent abnormality? One dreads to think of the liability should someone with an allergy to berries (or, for that matter, blasts) happen to inadvertently consume an erroneous beverage.</p>
<p>I hope this letter finds you well, and look forward to a resolution of this matter.</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>Simon</p>

<p>I am writing with regard to the filling of slot 7 in the vending machine (attached). For some weeks now, you appear to have been filling this slot with Berry Blast, not Dr Pepper as indicated. Please could you not do this? It is not very nice.</p>

						<p>Or, “what I&#8217;ve learnt from cricketers.” </p>
<p>A side-effect of following a series that takes place entirely while I&#8217;m asleep is that I end up reading rather more cricketing ramblings than is strictly healthy. Good has come out of it, however, as it turns out that I have a major failing I need to address. We&#8217;re not talking about my tendency to go deeper than normal at third man or anything like that; it&#8217;s more basic. Here&#8217;s Shane Warne: </p>
<p>“To win 5-0 is a fantastic achievement by this group of guys. This team&#8217;s played some sensational cricket through the whole summer. England have played some good cricket at times too, but when the big moments came the Australian team stood up.” </p>
<p>Ricky Ponting elaborates: “For the guys to stand up, myself to get some runs and to feel I&#8217;ve led the side well has been enjoyable.” </p>
<p>Even English cricketers are at it, as Ian Bell goes still further: “Every one of us needed to stand up and be counted. It was seriously important to do well here.” </p>
<p>You see where I&#8217;m going with this, and it&#8217;s not abuse of the reflexive pronoun. No, my problem is that I spend almost all of every day sitting down. Standing up is not part of my office repertoire, let alone pointless enumeration. At no time, moreover, do I ever feel tempted to put my hand up or come to the party. Standing up for no reason in an office just doesn&#8217;t work. </p>
<p>“What are you doing?”<br />
“Standing up.”<br />
“Uh, okay. Why?”<br />
“Just because. Erm … would you mind counting me?”<br />
“What?”<br />
“It&#8217;s sort of important. Please?”<br />
“Er, okay… &#8216;one&#8217;.”<br />
“Thanks.”<br />
“Feel better?”<br />
“Not really. Canapè?” </p>
<p>Goddamn cricketers.</p>
