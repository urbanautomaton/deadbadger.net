He was about 13 or so; probably 14. He was the latest in a continent-spanning dynasty of Frankies, named (if memory serves me well) after one of my grandmother&#8217;s early beaus. For many a year there&#8217;s been a Frankie in the Coffey household, terrorising pigeons (or in the New Zealand version, Kakapos and rabbits). I don&#8217;t remember my grandfather ever objecting to this naming scheme, although I do remember him putting the boot quite firmly to an earlier Frankie, when it had expressed its displeasure at being ousted from my grandfather&#8217;s favourite chair a little too forcefully.</p>
<p>The decease of a family member, furred or otherwise, is a slightly weird occasion. My mother went into overdrive, ensuring that Frankie passed on with dignity and in no minor luxury. He sort of stopped eating a while back, the response to which was to provide him with a bewildering array of foodstuffs, such that his slightest, most passing whim might find itself fulfilled on our kitchen floor. When last I went home, there were separate plates of poached fish, red meat, cream, beaten egg, dried biscuits and water on the floor opposite the oven. There can&#8217;t be many cats who spend their last days being fed tapas, but he was lacking only chorizo, to be frank (and he was).</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, convinced that Frankie was about to shuffle off, my mother spent the whole night on the sofa, keeping him company while he slept by the fireplace. Then last week, seized again by the conviction that tonight was the night, and aware that an early morning shift at the hospital awaited, mum wandered down the garden at 10pm to pick out and dig a small plot for the dear boy. Initially overcome by emotion, the inherent absurdity of the situation soon took hold, and thus the neighbours were treated to the sight of my mother cackling maniacally in the darkness while digging a child-sized grave next to the syringa. I&#8217;m sure they understood.</p>
<p>Anyway. Goodbye, Frankie, you grumpy old curmudgeon. May the pigeons be slow, and the roast dinners left unguarded. We&#8217;ll miss you.</p>

It&#8217;s the only explanation. Why else would they reject bags of perfectly good rubbish based solely on the colour of the bag? As I type this, there rests outside our front door one forlorn sack of onion cuttings, Pots (ex-Noodle) and furry formerly-decorative fruit (only slightly used). Its crime? Being blue. Our binmen apparently didn&#8217;t know how to deal with this outrageous violation of the sacred norms of binmanning (or “The Job”, as they call it). So they left it.</p>
<p>Are health and safety regulations preventing our binmen from touching erroneously toned bags? Did it clash too glaringly with the orange of our recycling bags, offending their Changing Rooms-honed aesthetics? Does blue denote a hitherto unknown rubbish category which is collected by binmen with special training in such bags? What do they think we&#8217;ve put in it? They took away almost a complete dead pig once, because we&#8217;d managed to cover it in enough (black) bags. I don&#8217;t know what makes these grizzled, smelly men balk at an unassuming bag of odds &#8216;n ends, but if they&#8217;re not touching it, I&#8217;m certainly not. Fortunately, I have learnt from lengthy experiments in our fridge a universal truth: everything turns black if you leave it long enough.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
						<p>Robots suck. You can take my word for it; I&#8217;m a roboticist. That sucks, too. The very word roboticist derives from the Sanskrit phrase “rhob dh&#8217;syss”, lit. “tilter at windmills”. A roboticist&#8217;s life oscillates continually between fervid imaginings of what some idealised, data-rich robot might conceivably do, and despair at the seemingly ineluctable difficulty of getting his actual robot to work out what the fuck it is looking at (is it a doorway? Is it a fowl of some sort? Your robot can&#8217;t tell, but it&#8217;s damn well going to wait until whatever it is lays an egg to find out). Eventually the roboticist loses all hope and simply constructs a nest of blankets in his office, emerging only to harangue less wearied students with a rolled up copy of <em>New Scientist</em> and some hallucinogen-laced polo mints. Depending on age, the roboticist emerges from this smelly larval stage as either a City trader or a hobo.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to see how people feel threatened by such beings (robots or roboticists), but from the unending stream of articles on the BBC detailing the latest public handwringing over what will happen when our robots start demanding rights, I gather that this is a matter of some concern for many. Presumably they dread the day when gay robot weddings abound, machines are breaking wind in the halls of the mighty, and “paedophilautomata” is the latest elocutionary challenge for the massed readers of the Mail.</p>
<p>Scary stuff, but I can assure you this will not happen in our lifetimes. We will not need to grant robots rights any more than we will need to grant them to our toaster. We have yet to produce a robot with even the intellectual capacity of a reality TV contestant, so it seems unlikely that any rule more complex than “go <code>*beep*</code> if you feel bored” will be needed. If robots ever take over the world, it will be entirely by accident; feel reassured that the laser beam destined to melt your eyes from their sockets will almost certainly have been directed there by its owner in a cack-handed attempt to provide you with some toast, or perhaps in the misguided impression that your eyebrows are really murderous caterpillars about to devour your brain.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take an example. Look at the following picture of an arse:</p>
<p><img src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/hucknall_500.jpg" alt="Mick Hucknall" title="Mick Hucknall contemplating the meaning of being" width="500" height="196" class="size-full wp-image-419 aligncenter" srcset="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/hucknall_500.jpg 500w, /wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/hucknall_500-300x117.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>Within moments, your evolution-honed senses alerted you to the danger, and kicked in your fight-or-flight response. Our putative robot, however, is stumped. It can&#8217;t tell Mick Hucknall from a haddock. Even if we could communicate the necessary concepts of loathing and revulsion to a robot, it would have no idea whether to apply them here. It might even attempt to cuddle Hucknall, giving him all the validation he needs to produce a 3CD career retrospective, complete with bonus tracks. Is that what we want? <em>Is</em> it?</p>
<p>Robots will not take over the world. We should not be worrying about instituting three laws constraining robot behaviour, unless we&#8217;re excessively worried about protecting our ankles from errant vacuum cleaners. What sort of stupid world is it where we worry about technology that probably won&#8217;t ever exist, and yet Mick Hucknall walks free?</p>
<p>A very stupid one indeed.</p>

There comes a point in every young man&#8217;s life when he decides to fly the coop; usually about the same time that the young man realises he&#8217;s living in a coop, not a house. This is why coops are constructed at ground level, as the young man will shortly make a second horrible discovery, and no-one wants him to fall too far.</p>
<p>Anyway, the point of this is that Will and I are moving away from Balham, our home for the last four years. In that time, like a weary pornstar it&#8217;s gone from up and coming to well and truly upped and come. The borough of a thousand catchphrases is now positively glowing and sticky with respectability; we even have an organic supermarket, where the organs are plentiful but shoppers still somewhat scarce.</p>
<p>In our time at this house we have set fire to many things. Dan set fire to the whole garden almost as soon as we got here. Will set fire to an electronic dancing chicken. We set fire to enough Christmas trees to fuel a fragrantly pine-scented power station. We set fire to a whole pig. Will wanted to set the pig spinning at 120rpm while on fire, but we thought that would have been a bit showy. Understatement is everything when you&#8217;re setting fire to pigs.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not all been conflagration. We built a snowman in the front doorway one winter, and a passing Brazilian asked us to take his photo with it. The snowmanwall melted (overnight; not because of the Brazilian&#8217;s immense warmth), deluging the basement (and thus Tim, who was occupying it at the time) with frigid water. Oh, how we laughed. Speaking of the basement, we had an indigent millionaire living down there for a while, which was as confusing as it sounds. In fact, the basement has been occupied for a total of over a year since we moved in, despite the rather obvious downsides of slugs and descending snowmen to name but two.</p>
<p>Anyway. Having remained here while, by my count, no fewer than 14 other residents passed through, it&#8217;s time for pastures new. In my case that involves a daring voyage north of the river where I shall join the residents of Kentish Town in fending off disoriented trendies overflowing from Camden; in Will&#8217;s case he&#8217;s going to live in an actual pasture for a bit. The young man never falls far from the coop.</p>
<hr />
<p>* This only works if you pronounce Balham “Blaahm”, as a posh person might. Try it with a nice Chablis, or while striking a poor person.</p>

						<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-56" title="&quot;Because it isn't there.&quot;" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/notthere.jpg" alt="Hole in the ground" />You&#8217;ve probably already heard of our escalating prisons crisis here in the omnibenevolent UK. What you won&#8217;t have heard is the reason, which I discovered today: prison is vastly preferable to a large amount of housing in our major cities. Far from being incorrigible scallies, most of the inhabitants of our penal system are in fact middle managers unable to get urban accomodation without perpetrating some minor felony.</p>
<p>I viewed a flat today near Holloway prison, and it made me want to cry. Walking from Holloway tube to the property along what must surely be the UK&#8217;s first residential motorway, I passed at least seven KFCs, four Quality Chickens* and an inexplicable Waitrose, the latter presumably there to cater for newly elevated tastes among local shoplifters.</p>
<p>Turning on to Parkhurst Road, things started to look up. Well, <em>I</em> started to look up, which I swiftly regretted. Initially the boarded up houses seemed an improvement on the unremitting phalanxes of discount stores, and indeed they would have been, had I not spotted a guy peering over the plywood of a former first floor window, watching my every step as I passed his house. Ah, neighbours.</p>
<p>Still flushed with the initial excitement of flat-hunting for the first time in four years, I thought to myself that this would be fine, assuming the flat itself wasn&#8217;t a hole in the ground.</p>
<p>It was, of course, a hole in the ground. In fact to call it a hole in the ground does grave injustice to the many fine holes in the ground that have been inhabited at various times by soldiers, dowsers, and the just plain shy. My mind is slowly embellishing the memory with three foot ceilings, rat carcasses and vampire bat colonies as the episode recedes further into my personal mythology, but while I&#8217;m still capable of accurate recall I offer the following for the reference of any estate agents reading this:</p>
<ol>
<li class="level1">
<div class="li">A bare patch of ground inhabited by comatose crack addicts and a bush that would not look out of place in the arctic tundra is not a “garden”.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1">
<div class="li">Similarly, if the occupier has to isolate his property from said “garden” with a reinforced, motorised metal security shutter at night, it is not “his” garden.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1">
<div class="li">A “luxury tiled bathroom” must contain at least one luxury. The tiles do not count, nor indeed do <em>Aspergillus penicillium</em> infestations. No, not even if it cures bronchitis while you shower.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1">
<div class="li">A “double room” is not one in to which you can fit one double mattress, touching three walls with only a bit of a bend at each side. That is a cupboard with a mattress in it.</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Given the topic of my my first post on this blog, it seems that it&#8217;s now come full circle. Presumably it will disappear up its own arse any day now.</p>
<hr />
<p>* Fried chicken stores, you understand &#8211; I&#8217;m not expressing admiration for the livestock I saw en route, although it was a <em>lovely</em> llama.</p>
