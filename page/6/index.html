						<p>In a development that has shocked Fleet Street, it transpired today that the world has run out of news. Pensioners were seen roaming the street, befuddled at the lack of stimulus from their cathode ray sets, and commuters on the Tube were heard to wonder, &#8220;don&#8217;t we have some kind of bat-signal that summons Amy Winehouse?&#8221; Guardian Editor Alan Rusbridger, interviewed by the Daily Telegraph in a vain hope of a newsworthy utterance, responded:</p>
<blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t know; aren&#8217;t the government trying to ban anything at the moment? That&#8217;s usually good. Has someone given Max Clifford a ring?</p></blockquote>
<p>Never wanting to be seen to let The Public down, the BBC gamely tried to wish news into existence, but its efforts only highlighted the global shortage:</p>
<p><img src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/breakingnews.gif" alt="Breaking News!" title="In other Breaking News, red wine is both good and bad for you, and women like chocolate." width="473" height="253" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41" srcset="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/breakingnews.gif 473w, /wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/breakingnews-300x160.gif 300w" sizes="(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px" /></p>
<p>Rupert Murdoch is believed to have secretly assembled a crack team of news-creating professionals, working in secrecy to concoct a global pretext for newpaper vending, but the effort was abandoned when it was pointed out that this was the plot of the awful James Bond outing <a href="http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0120347/" target="_blank">Tomorrow Never Dies</a>.</p>
<p>Indeed, all fresh newsmaking efforts have thus far been in vain, and the assembled members of the press are currently reduced to asking each other for comments in between running repeats of past glories. In one particularly upsetting incident, a confused Michael Buerk had to be turned away from a central London drinking establishment after he stormed the bar and demanded to know where the Ethiopian infants were being kept. He was last seen heading north on Charing Cross road, berating pedestrians with an unplugged lip mike and a heavily-gnawed fried chicken thigh. Members of the public are advised to phone their local news bureau if he does anything particularly outrageous.</p>

						<p>I believe it was Al Pacino, starring as cross-border horticulturalist Tony Montana in the movie <em>Scarface</em>, who said:</p>
<blockquote><p>First you get the borage, then you get the power. Then, you get the bees.</p></blockquote>
<p>It was something like that, anyway.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s back up a bit. Despite having lived at our current flat for over a year now, it&#8217;s only recently that I feel we&#8217;ve started to take full advantage of its best feature, the Most Overlooked Balcony In The World™, and this feeling is owed almost entirely to vice. A wall planter-based herb garden may seem an unlikely place for a hotbed of sin, but so it has transpired.</p>
<p>Having read recently that borage is &#8220;much beloved by bees,&#8221; and bees being much beloved by me, I decided to plant me some <em>borago officialis</em> (none of that cheap knock-off rubbish). Being of confident mind, I decided to start from seeds, and duly sowed, feeling faintly filthy as I impregnated our flowerbeds. Vice-y, but hardly Miami.</p>
<p>After a month or so of faithfully watering the bare patch of soil (which I was beginning to suspect of mocking me), sprouts appeared! A hit rate of only 50%, granted, but still sprouts. There followed two months of paranoid counter-slug activities, stopping short only of applying Agent Orange to the neighbours&#8217; ivy, suspected of harbouring the intruders. But now our borage is glorious, slug-proof in its enormity, and most importantly, ready to be much beloved by bees. And boy, howdy, is it ever beloved.</p>
<p><a href="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/borage_bee.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-34" title="Hot bee lovin'" src="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/borage_bee.jpg" alt="Hot bee lovin\'" width="500" height="236" srcset="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/borage_bee.jpg 500w, /wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/borage_bee-300x141.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>Mere minutes after it flowered, our borage was, well, deflowered. As I watched from the doorway, a fine apian fellow set to beloving our plant in as comprehensive a manner as I&#8217;ve ever witnessed. Proud though I was, however, I couldn&#8217;t help feeling a little uncomfortable as hot bee lovin&#8217; continued apace in front of my eyes. Impressive stamina for a little guy, but a bit much before my first cup of tea. &#8220;Get a room,&#8221; I thought, then went <a href="http://shop.ebay.co.uk/items/Pet-Supplies__bee-hive_W0QQ_nkwZbeeQ20hiveQQQ5ftrksidZp3286Q2ec0Q2em1QQProductType42be380bZBeehives592777e1QQ_dmptZUKQ5fPetQ5fSuppliesQ5fBeeQ5fKeepingQQ_npmvZ3QQ_sacatZ1281QQ_ssovZ1" target="blank">looking for one</a> on eBay. No point attracting bees if you&#8217;re not going to keep them.</p>
<p>The other addition to the balcony is complementary in a sense &#8211; a shisha purchased from down the road that is pleasing to eye, ear and lung, and doubles as a handy smoker when the bees get too frisky. A line in apple-smoked honey will be available from all good Kentish Town stores* very soon.</p>
<p>*Okay, Woolworths.</p>

						<p>Yes, it&#8217;s a new home, in preparation for when I finally leave Imperial and lose my lovely free hosting. And yes, I do plan to write here more often, although it&#8217;ll still be fairly sporadic until at least September. I&#8217;m importing old posts at random as and when I can be bothered (it&#8217;s a boring, manual process), meaning that mostly my favourites will be turning up at first. Isn&#8217;t narcissism great?</p>
<p>The old site is <a href="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~spc03" target="_blank">still available</a> as usual and I&#8217;ll crosspost things to both places, because it&#8217;ll make me feel as if I&#8217;ve been twice as productive. These little insights into the mind of a layabout, eh?</p>

						<p>Using your face, that is. Remonstrating with your own face is fine, but not in public. Anyway. If I&#8217;m not feeling entertaining, I might as well be irritable. Today it is Ruth Kelly who is irritating me. Here are the things about Ruth Kelly that irritate me:</p>
<ol>
<li class="level1">
<div class="li">Her face</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There&#8217;s more to it than that, of course, but mostly it boils down to her face. This time it&#8217;s something that <a class="urlextern" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6738603.stm" rel="nofollow" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6738603.stm">came out of her face</a>. Hit it, Ruth:</p>
<blockquote><p>I do think translation has been used too frequently and sometimes without thought added to the consequences. So, for example, it&#8217;s quite possible for someone to come here from Pakistan and elsewhere in the world and to find that materials are routinely translated into their mother tongue and therefore not have the incentive to learn English.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, in this story Ruth (pictured below preventing her face from invading Poland) continues the rather bizarre trend of Labour pandering to small-minded idiots who are unaccountably concerned that they won&#8217;t be able to order some of what they undoubtedly consider to be “filthy foreign muck”. Why on earth people who have less contact with brown people than Prince Charles&#8217;s underwear and who consider anything with more flavour than frozen peas to be a sign of dangerous culinary licentiousness should be concerned about communicating with the Azims down at number 43 is beyond me, particularly given the paucity of conversational material they&#8217;ll have available should some sort of detente inexplicably be reached, but there you go. My, what a long sentence.</p>
<p><img class="alignright" title="Ruth Kelly and her Face" src="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~spc03/_media/images:misc:ruthkellysface.jpg?w=&amp;h=&amp;cache=cache" alt="Ruth Kelly and her Face" /></p>
<p>Leaving aside little Britain&#8217;s prejudices, let&#8217;s move on to Ruth, who really ought to know better. Of course, she doesn&#8217;t, as her face is to logical reasoning what the presence of an elderly nude man is to the proper enjoyment of a fish supper. She starts out well, mind you, in stating that learning the English language is “key” to helping migrants to integrate.</p>
<p>Where she falls down, of course, is everywhere else. And unlike normal falling down, which is funny, Ruth and her face fall down in deeply annoying ways. From this fixation with language-as-integrator she leaps like a gazelle with an annoying face to the conclusion that the government should stop translating its bureaucratic documents. In so doing, she makes lots of ludicrous assumptions, which I will now point out so that enterprising (read: less lazy than me) members of the public can print them out and staple them to her face.</p>
<p>Firstly, she assumes that immigrants aren&#8217;t already integrating. This is a boring one. Even someone with a normal face could make this mistake. So, too, the assumption that the government should Do Something. I <a class="wikilink1" title="personal:blog:syllogisms_for_the_timid" href="/~spc03/personal:blog:syllogisms_for_the_timid">covered this earlier</a>, but it&#8217;s so ingrained into politicians&#8217; minds that to hold it specifically against Ruth would seem churlish. It would also involve getting closer to her face than is prudent, so let&#8217;s keep our powder dry.</p>
<p>No, the most glaring little idiocy, it seems to me, is Kelly&#8217;s blithe assumption that immigrants essentially have one motivation in life, and one motivation only: to comprehend local authority forms. Now, let it not be said that an evening spent parsing the H19-B (application for auxiliary wheelie bin) is not an enthralling night for all the family (section C aside, which contains language, and scenes of mild peril). But in the end, I really do question whether newly arrived migrants&#8217; main aspirational concern is to penetrate the core of English bureaucracy, and taste the sweet fruits therein.</p>
<p>After all, this is hardly Tolstoy, for whose appreciation learning Russian is considered by some to be a prerequisite, and whose reward of comprehension might truly be worth the effort. Indeed, those of us in near full command of the English language are painfully aware that government forms are fully capable of being incomprehensible in whatever language you try to decipher them. In fact, given that translators go through years of training, while form-writers seem to need no more qualification than a <a class="wikilink1" title="personal:blog:pro_forma" href="/~spc03/personal:blog:pro_forma">deep hatred of the reader</a>, it&#8217;s quite possible that applying for a passport in Swahili is considerably easier than it is in the original English.</p>
<p>Now, I realise that Ruth, whose entire life will have been subsumed by politics from an early age, might not comprehend that there are those of us who have other pursuits, other joys in our lives than heading down to the council offices to read some pamphlets on parking practices. So what I would like you, both of my loyal readers, to do, is this: write to Ruth Kelly. Perhaps sympathise with her about her face. But then describe to her a joy in your life. It may be the smile of a newborn baby; it may be the frisson of excitement you get from being thrown out of maternity wards &#8211; I don&#8217;t know. But maybe &#8211; just maybe &#8211; if we can convince this woman and her face that life outside of government does indeed exist, then the mist will clear from her eyes, and she will run away to join the circus as God surely intended.</p>
<p>If you could write to her in Urdu, that would be even better.</p>
