					<description><![CDATA[Thanks Anne, both for the kind words and the invaluable advice in skirting the law.

That said, you&#039;ve made me kind of curious as to what the law actually &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; now. And you&#039;re quite right; according to the Protection of Badgers Act (1992):

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;(3)&lt;/b&gt;
A person is guilty of an offence if, except as permitted by or under this Act, he has in his possession or under his control any dead badger or any part of, or anything derived from, a dead badger.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So presumably the whole shaving section of this guide would be right out. However:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A person is not guilty of an offence under subsection (3) above if he shows that—

&lt;b&gt;(a)&lt;/b&gt; the badger had not been killed, or had been killed otherwise than in contravention of the provisions of this Act or of the [1973 c. 57.] Badgers Act 1973; or&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;(b)&lt;/b&gt; the badger or other thing in his possession or control had been sold (whether to him or any other person) and, at the time of the purchase, the purchaser had had no reason to believe that the badger had been killed in contravention of any of those provisions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So there you go; you can keep a lucky badger&#039;s foot (or pancreas, for that matter) as long as you prove that the rest of the badger is hobbling around somewhere, in dire need of half an endocrine system.

The things you learn, eh?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I arrived at your blog in search of (not necessarily badger related) road kill legislation (I since found that you&#039;re not allowed to bin them, just in case you should chose to take your own advice in sight of the law).

Anyway, though not what I was looking for, you did have me snorting into my tea and alarming a few people in the office, so thank you for that. Nothing quite like finding something funny enough to give you simultaneous facial burns and breathing difficulty when you didn&#039;t expect it. You&#039;re in my bookmarks!]]></description>
