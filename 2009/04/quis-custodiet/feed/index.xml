					<description><![CDATA[Well, precisely. Do the Police &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; have the resources to follow up on everyone who does one of these &quot;suspicious&quot; things? Of course not. And they must know that too, which means this poster is not actually about getting us to dob in camera enthusiasts, it&#039;s about breeding a general sense of mistrust among the public, and reliance on the all-seeing Police.

What pisses me off most, though, is the missing comma. &lt;i&gt;What happened&lt;/i&gt; weeks before a shopper reported someone studying the CCTV cameras, motherfuckers?

If they&#039;re going to creep me out, they could at least have the basic decency to punctuate properly.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In Australia, we have a TV ad devoted to this very thing. It has about a dozen different voiceovers saying various things such as &quot;exchanged hands...&quot; &quot;downloaded suspicious documents...&quot; &quot;saw a suspicious person...&quot; It all seems a little paranoid, seeing as any of those could just be an innocent person going about their business. 

That poster is classic, however.]]></description>
