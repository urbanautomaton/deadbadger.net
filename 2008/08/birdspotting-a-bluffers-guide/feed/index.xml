					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s not Handa, I&#039;d remember a name like that; I forget where it actually is though. Judging by the order of my photos it has to be somewhere on the Orkney mainland.

And yes, I&#039;m pretty sure we did see some genuine skuas, although perhaps not &lt;i&gt;quite&lt;/i&gt; as many as were claimed at the time. Fortunately they just gave us the evil eye and occasionally went &quot;arrk.&quot; I&#039;m not sure I would&#039;ve got out of the car if I&#039;d known about the divebombing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[At the risk of exposing myself as a twitcher, arctic skuas in seagull-like densities may not be so scandalous, depending on where you were in western Scotland. Handa Island, just off the very-north west of Scotland, has masses of the things. They&#039;re particularly fond of dive-bombing, a charming greeting involving wacking the subject in the back of the head with their full weight behind taloned feet. Other than that they&#039;re quite nice though. Your picture looks an awful lot like Great Stack on Handa, but then one sea-cliff is kinda like another really, red pandas aside.]]></description>
