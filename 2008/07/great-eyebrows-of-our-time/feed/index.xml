					<description><![CDATA[I am heartened that the &#039;Connelly&#039; brow has been given due recognition and thank you for bringing this to my attention. I was recently the victim of an unprovoked and savage attack upon my brows (which had been, prior to the butchery, not entirely dissimilar to Ms Connelly&#039;s) by an expert in the art of Threading. Threading involves yanking out the hairs using a reel of cotton. More than that, I can&#039;t tell you as I had my eyes tightly closed at the time. More fool me. An expert in threading she undoubtedly was, but an expert in &#039;styling the brow&#039;, she was most certainly not. I came out of this London salon looking less Connelly and more Pierrot The Clown circa 1970; a resemblance not helped by having extremely buggy red eyes from crying all the way back home to my little pad in Surrey. The devastating execution of her judgment (which she appeared inappropriately proud of), to remove all but a single file line of hairs, was based on an absolute prejudice against a full brow.  You&#039;ll be relieved to hear my eyebrows have grown back although the experience has left me understandably shaken and wary of cotton reels.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The final two sentences (Napoleon, et al) of this article were, I think, the finest two sentences ever written in the English language; in the context of an article written about the prodigious eyebrows of a former UK Prime Minister.

No, but seriously. 

Thank you. I &#060;3 the way you write.
